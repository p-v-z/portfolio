                Since I was a child, I have had a lifelong passion for computer
                technologies, particularly in the realm of video games. I have
                honed my skills in design, visual, audio, and logical reasoning
                to be able to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience. I
                have a good amount of work experience in Unity C# development,
                including AR/VR applications, as well as experience in web
                development with JavaScript and cloud computing. My adaptability
                and ability to quickly learn and understand new concepts and
                technologies have allowed me to successfully contribute to
                professional, high-quality projects which run live and make
                people lots of money. Some of my proudest achievementa including
                winning a prize for the creation of a location based video game,
                and speaking at an international scientific conference.
