              Since I was a child, I have had a lifelong passion for computer
              technologies, particularly in the realm of video games. I have
              honed my skills in design, visual, audio, and logical reasoning to
              be able to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience. I have
              a good amount of work experience in Unity C# development,
              including AR/VR applications, as well as experience in web
              development with JavaScript and cloud computing. My adaptability
              and ability to quickly learn and understand new concepts and
              technologies have allowed me to successfully contribute to
              professional, high-quality projects which run live and make people
              lots of money. Some of my proudest achievementa including winning
              a prize for the creation of a location based video game, and
              speaking at an international scientific conference.
